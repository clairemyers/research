  <h1>The History of Communication Technologies</h1>
  <h2>Telegraph</h2>
  <p>The telegraph was a vital conduit for communication in the mid 1800’s.
    Samuel Morse and his colleagues Leonard Gale and Alfred Vail developed the telegraph in the United States while Sir William Cooke and Sir Charles Wheatstone undertook a similar project in England, which was soon adapted for railroad signaling. In
    the United States, Morse and his associates developed a code famously known as “Morse code,” a series of dots and dashes that could be translated to English letters. Their telegraph required a simple electrical circuit for the code to be
    transmitted. One year after receiving funding for a telegraph system between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland, Vail received from Morse this famous message: “What hath God wrought!” Soon after, telegraph systems began popping up all
    across America. Improvements to the telegraph including insulation and the ability to transmit multiple messages on a single line further assisted the sharing of information by the telegraph by allowing it to be shared faster and more accurately.
    This innovation led to the development of our modern telephones.
